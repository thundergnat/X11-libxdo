X11::libxdo

Version: 0.1.2

Raku bindings to the [libxdo X11 automation library](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool).

Note: This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The tests are under construction and some may not work on your computer. Several functions are not yet implemented, but a large core group is.

Many of the test files do not actally run tests that can be checked for correctness. (Many of the object move & resize tests for example.) Rather, they attempt to perform an action and fail/pass based on if the attempt does or doesn't produce an error.

Not all libxdo functions are supported by every window manager. In general, mouse info & move and window info, move, & resize routines seem to be well supported, others... not so much.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use X11::libxdo;

my $xdo = Xdo.new;

say 'Version: ', $xdo.version;

say 'Active window id: ', my $active = $xdo.get-active-window;

say 'Active window title: ', $xdo.get-window-name($active);

say "Pause for a bit...";
sleep 4; # pause for a bit

loop {
    my ($x, $y, $window-id, $screen) = $xdo.get-mouse-info;
    my $name = (try $xdo.get-window-name($window-id) if $window-id)
       // 'No name set';

    my $line = "Mouse location: $x, $y, Window under mouse - ID: " ~
       $window-id ~ ', Name: ' ~ $name ~ ", Screen #: $screen";

    print "\e[H\e[JMove mouse around screen; move to top to exit.\n", $line;

    # exit if pointer moved to top of screen
    say '' and last if $y < 1;

    # update periodically.
    sleep .05;
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Raku bindings to the [libxdo X11 automation library](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool).

Requires that libxdo-dev library is installed and accessible.

<table class="pod-table">
<thead><tr>
<th>Platform</th> <th>Install Method</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td>Debian and Ubuntu</td> <td>[sudo] apt-get install libxdo-dev</td> </tr> <tr> <td>FreeBSD</td> <td>[sudo] pkg install libxdo-dev</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fedora</td> <td>[sudo] dnf install libxdo-dev</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OSX</td> <td>[sudo] brew install libxdo-dev</td> </tr> <tr> <td>OpenSUSE</td> <td>[sudo] zypper install libxdo-dev</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Source Code on GitHub</td> <td>https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool/releases</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Many (most?) of the xdo methods take a window ID # in their parameters. This is an integer ID# and MUST be passed as an unsigned Int. In general, to act on the currently active window, set the window ID to 0 or just leave blank.

Note that many of the methods will require a small delay for them to finish before moving on to the next, especially when performing several actions in a row. Either do a short sleep or a .activate-window($window-ID) to give the action time to complete before moving on to the next action.

There are several broad categories of methods available.

  * Misc

  * Mouse

  * Window

  * Keystrokes

  * Desktop

Miscellaneous
-------------

```raku
.version()
```

Get the library version.

Takes no parameters.

Returns the version string of the current libxdo library.

--

```raku
.get_symbol_map()
```

Get modifier symbol pairs.

Takes no parameters.

--

```raku
.search(%query)
```

Reimplementation of the libxdo search function to give greater flexibility under Raku.

    .search( :name(), :class(), :ID(), :pid() )

Search for an open window where the title contains the exact string 'libxdo':

    .search( :name('libxdo') )

Keystrokes
----------

```raku
.type( $window, $string, $delay? )
```

Type a string to the specified window.

If you want to send a specific key or key sequence, such as "alt+l", you want instead send-sequence(...).

Not well supported under many window managers or by many applications unfortunately. Somewhat of a crapshoot as to which applications pay attention to this function. Web browsers tend to; (Firefox and Chrome tested), many other applications do not. Need to try it to see if it will work in your situation.

Takes three parameters:

  * int $window: The window you want to send keystrokes to or 0 for the current window.

  * string $string: The string to type, like "Hello world!"

Returns 0 on success !0 on failure.

--

```raku
.send-sequence( $window, $string, $delay? )
```

This allows you to send keysequences by symbol name. Any combination of X11 KeySym names separated by '+' are valid. Single KeySym names are valid, too.

Examples: "l" "semicolon" "alt+Return" "Alt_L+Tab"

Takes three parameters:

  * int $window: The window you want to send keystrokes to or 0 for the current window.

  * string $string: The string keysequence to send.

  * int $delay: Optional delay between keystrokes in microseconds. 12000 is a decent choice if you don't have other plans.

Returns 0 on success !0 on failure.

--

```raku
.send-key-press( $window, $string, $delay? )
