=head1 NAME

X11::libxdo

Version: 0.1.2

Raku bindings to the L<libxdo X11 automation library|https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool>.

Note: This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The tests are under construction and some
may not work on your computer. Several functions are not yet implemented,
but a large core group is.

Many of the test files do not actally run tests that can be checked for
correctness. (Many of the object move & resize tests for example.)
Rather, they attempt to perform an action and fail/pass based on if the attempt
does or doesn't produce an error.

Not all libxdo functions are supported by every window manager. In general,
mouse info & move and window info, move, & resize routines seem to be well
supported, others... not so much.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use X11::libxdo;

my $xdo = Xdo.new;

say 'Version: ', $xdo.version;

say 'Active window id: ', my $active = $xdo.get-active-window;

say 'Active window title: ', $xdo.get-window-name($active);

say "Pause for a bit...";
sleep 4; # pause for a bit

loop {
    my ($x, $y, $window-id, $screen) = $xdo.get-mouse-info;
    my $name = (try $xdo.get-window-name($window-id) if $window-id)
       // 'No name set';

    my $line = "Mouse location: $x, $y, Window under mouse - ID: " ~
       $window-id ~ ', Name: ' ~ $name ~ ", Screen #: $screen";

    print "\e[H\e[JMove mouse around screen; move to top to exit.\n", $line;

    # exit if pointer moved to top of screen
    say '' and last if $y < 1;

    # update periodically.
    sleep .05;
}

=end code


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Raku bindings to the [libxdo X11 automation library](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool).

Requires that libxdo-dev library is installed and accessible.

=begin table
Platform 	          |  Install Method
======================================================
Debian and Ubuntu     |  [sudo] apt-get install libxdo-dev

Fedora                |  [sudo] dnf install libxdo-dev

=end table


Many (most?) of the xdo methods take a window ID # in their parameters. This is
an integer ID# and MUST be passed as an unsigned Int. In general, to act on the
currently active window, set the window ID to 0 or just leave blank.

Note that many of the methods will require a small delay for them to finish
before moving on to the next, especially when performing several actions in a
row. Either do a short sleep or a .activate-window($window-ID) to give the
action time to complete before moving on to the next action.

There are several broad categories of methods available.

=item Misc
=item Mouse
=item Window
=item Keystrokes
=item Desktop

=head2 Miscellaneous

=begin code :lang<raku>

--
=begin code :lang<raku>
.search(%query)
=end code

Reimplementation of the libxdo search function to give greater flexibility under
Raku.

May seach for a name, class, ID or pid or any combination, against a string / regex.

    .search( :name(), :class(), :ID(), :pid() )

Search for an open window where the title contains the exact string 'libxdo':

     .search( :name(rx:i['raku']) )

Returns a hash { :name(), :class(), :ID(), :pid() } pairs of the first match
found for one of the search parameters.

.type( $window, $string, $delay? )
=end code

Type a string to the specified window.

If you want to send a specific key or key sequence, such as "alt+l", you
want instead send-sequence(...).

Not well supported under many window managers or by many applications
unfortunately. Somewhat of a crapshoot as to which applications pay attention to
this function. Web browsers tend to; (Firefox and Chrome tested), many other
applications do not. Need to try it to see if it will work in your situation.

Takes three parameters:

=item int    $window: The window you want to send keystrokes to or 0 for the current window.

=begin code :lang<raku>
.send-sequence( $window, $string, $delay? )
=end code

This allows you to send keysequences by symbol name. Any combination
of X11 KeySym names separated by '+' are valid. Single KeySym names
are valid, too.

Examples:  "l"   "semicolon"  "alt+Return"  "Alt_L+Tab"

Takes three parameters:

=item int    $window: The window you want to send keystrokes to or 0 for the current window.
=item string $string: The string keysequence to send.
=item int    $delay:  Optional delay between keystrokes in microseconds. 12000 is a decent choice if you don't have other plans.

Returns 0 on success !0 on failure.
