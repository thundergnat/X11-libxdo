Slow Text:
{"\r\n\r\n"}
This is a paragraph of text. It is kind of boring, but I needed something in
 here and figured this is (marginally) more interesting than Hello World!
 multiple times.
{"\r\n\r\n"}
Sorry, can not automatically close this window (or tab, as the case may be)
 safely.
{"\r\n\r\n"}
Please close it manually when testing is done, but only AFTER testing is done.
{"\r\n\r\n"}
Probably should avoid touching the mouse and keyboard completely until then if possible.
{"\r\n\r\n"}
Thanks.
{"\r\n\r\n"}
Meanwhile; enjoy the show :-). Note: if nothing happens for more than 5 seconds
 or so, you may need to cancel the install, open a web browser window, and try
 the install again. Inter-process communication is a little flaky sometimes.
